# rm diacritic symbols, and lower
''.join(x for x in unicode.normalize('NFD', 'çéléphant') if unicode.category(x) != 'Mn').lower()

rm words like "interest" because that's a useful word in economy which carry no sentiment (increase/decrease interest rates e.g.)

rm words like "record", "spectaculaire", "extraordinaire" may be positive in general, but may be negative (especially during crisis)

add sombre, plonger, toxique...
